Our research focuses on the modeling and analysis of behaviors in both biological and engineered collectives and the design and validation of scalable control strategies for multi-robot systems. The main goals of our research are to:

* Develop control frameworks for designing robot behaviors provably produce target collective behaviors.

* Elucidate the mechanisms of self-organization in nature and translate them into robust strategies for robots.

Our interdisciplinary approach to research is enabled by the diversity of the lab membersâ€™ academic backgrounds, including mechanical, electrical, and aerospace engineering; robotics and mechatronics; mathematics and physics; and computer science. The lab is under the direction of Prof. Spring Berman, assistant professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.
