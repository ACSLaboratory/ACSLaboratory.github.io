## Introduction

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a powerful, FOSS version control software that has become a necessity for any open source project or company. It allows for workflows where multiple users work together on a code base with ease. The point of version control is to have...well...*control* over revision or changes to the code. This may seem esoteric at first, but it is actually really useful. This guide will provide a simple introduction for research labs to learn how to use git in their research environments.

**NOTE**: This guide is assuming that you are using a GNU/Linux distro or macOS. Another guide will be made for using the GitHub GUI.


## The Scenario

Imagine for a moment that you want to start new code for a swarm algorithm, but this code is going to be **HUGE**. It is going to require at least 3 total people to get done.

This is you:

and this is Dennis:

This is our team! Now lets begin the project!


# Creating a New Repository

To begin, open up the terminal and go to the directory (or folder) where you want to place the new project.
